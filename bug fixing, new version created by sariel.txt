fix cannot sign at the beginning 
fix upload twice

---

Mott Macdonald seem hv some bugs for uploading observation photos:
1) all photos will be uploaded twice, (please try with PR560),
2) some photos may be fail to upload

i will send u the update code, coz i modify some code for bug fixing and higher version sdk support on album pick and photo capture
also, a bug occured when i didnt type anything in Followup field, the signature fields will have some weird issues:
1) except the PM signature gesture view, other gesture views cannot draw
2) cannot save
not too sure, but i found the record in db which the filename is empty
